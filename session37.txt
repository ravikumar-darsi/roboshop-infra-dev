Let's say you have deployed catalogue,
After one week you have new release/newer version of catalogue should be release, then what should be done ?
In this scenario, new version of launch template should also be released,
Launch Template should not be deleted.. it shouldbe upgrade to newer version....

In this we started creating auto-scaling group

When HR recurits a new candidate, the candidate may be moved into bench or into a project? the best case is project.. if he/she is in project.. has to mapped with a team. 
In the same way..
Auto-Scaling group create a new instances and then they have to be attached with a target group 

Rolling Update
---------------
Let's say we have 4 instances and then,  4 new instances should be created and replace the old ones

How this works
One new instance created ---> once it is up, One old instance will be terminated.
Second new instance created ---> once it is up, Second old instance will be terminated.


First target group gets created
instance launch
provision
stop
ami
delete instance
launch template
auto scaling
