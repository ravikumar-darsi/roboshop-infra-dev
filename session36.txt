In this Session36:

First Launch the VPC  next the SG and then vpn

After Launching the VPN ----> connect to it and copy the file with extension .ovpn 
and copy it the locally and upload it in the open vpn application

Before Launching the databases, we have created the aws records using terraform provided modules
and writing the script for the aws records and do the terraform apply for the databases.

And now we have created the ALB using terraform and this ALB works on TCP Layer 7

By using this ALB we can redirect to different projects.

we have context path and Host path
**context path**:
daws67s.online/roboshop --> goes to roboshop project
daws67s.online/amazon ---> goes to amanzon project

**Host path**
roboshop.daws67s.online
amanzon.daws67s.online
