In this we will start creating with VPC

and then we created the security groups for all the modules 

and then we created VPN and make sure to turn the VPN

and later  we have configured the databases and for checking initally configuredand created mongoDB and 
later on remaining databases.

and we are focusing on creation of app and web tier:

There are two ways of creating those:
--> If the traffic increasing the auto-scailing will create the instance accordingly
a. When new instance cretaed, use user_data or provisioner with ansible to configur the server 
--> When the you are the  for first time ,
 a. First we create one instance
 b. Provision the instance using ansible
 c. stop the instance
 d. Take AMI -- > 10 Mins
 e. Update auto-scailing using  new AMI
   Slowly old instances will be replaced by new instances
   in future  if traffic increases, auto-scailing uses AMI to add the new instances.
